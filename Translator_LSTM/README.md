# A machine translator using LSTM model 

1. The data set used is the English-German sentence pair. The data is cleaned and store in the [Data_Cleaning](https://github.com/zzc01/Transformer/tree/main/Data_Cleaning) folder <br>
2. Here we use the LSTM model for the translator task. The sentences are first tokenized then sent into the following neural network <br>
3. The model training part is in the notebook [translator_lstm.ipynb](translator_lstm.ipynb)
4. The model is then evaluated using BLEU score in [evaluate.ipynb](evaluate.ipynb)
