# Translator Service Deployment 

The translator service will be deployed as an API call. As shown below we first prepare our model by cleaning the data set and training the model. Then we utilize Flask micro web framework to build our web application. After, Docker image will be use to containerize the model, web application, metadata, and other necessary tools. Finally, we will host our translator service on an AWS EC2 instance for user to access it through API POST calls. <br><br>
